CSCI 351, Fall 2020, Homework 3

Copy this file to your HOMEWORK directory on your student VM.
Copy this file to a file named homework3-answers.txt also in /root/HOMEWORK/ and 
edit it to include your answers.

Do the following steps and list what commands you used to accomplish each task.
There may be more than one way to do something but as long as it works, that's what 
matters.

 1) What kernel version are you using? 

 2) How many software packages do you have installed?

 3) Do a dnf update to upgrade your systems (dnf clean all ; dnf update).
 How many packages were updated?  List them. (Look in /var/log/dnf.log if you missed it)

 4) If there was a kernel update in your KVM VM, reboot your VM to 
    switch to the newer kernel.

 5) How many processes are there (running or not)?

 6) How much RAM is in use?

 7) Use tar to backup your /home directory to a file named /backup/home.tar.xz

 8) Use rsync to backup your /home dirctory to /backup/live/.

 9) How much space is /usr taking up?
 
10) How much free space is on /backup?

Be sure you showed what command you ran in addition to each answer or your 
answers are incomplete.
