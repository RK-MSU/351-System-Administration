<p><strong>Brightspace LE</strong> (formerly D2L, Desire 2 Learn)</p>
<div>While this is a "Blended" course all of the material will be made available via Brightspace to provide text resources, homework assignments. quizzes, the mid-term and final exam.&nbsp; Having all of the content available online is not new / just because of the COVID19 pandemic.&nbsp; I have been putting my materials online for years and it is a format that has worked well according to the course / instructor surveys.&nbsp; In the past I preferred paper measurement (quizzes, mid-term, final) but now those are in Brightspace too.&nbsp; Please note that I <strong>DO NOT</strong> use the Brightspace gradebook.&nbsp; Homework feedback and grade will be provided to you via a text file on your student virtual machine... which will encourage more ssh / shell usage.</div>
<p><strong>Course and Student Virtual Machines</strong></p>
<div>There is a <strong>course server</strong> for the class (<strong>csci351.cs.montana.edu</strong>) which has a <strong>public IP</strong> address and is accessible via ssh.&nbsp; You will need an ssh client to access the course server and there are several to pick from for Microsoft Windows, macOS, and Linux.&nbsp; Students can access the course server with their netid account.&nbsp; To access via campus wifi, you should be on the <a href="http://www.montana.edu/wifi/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">MSU Secure</a> network.&nbsp; If you have unresolvable issues with and can't connect to the MSU Secure network, MSU Guest may be used in conjunction with the <a href="http://www.montana.edu/uit/computing/desktop/vpn/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">MSU VPN</a> client.&nbsp; The course server is accessible from off-campus without requiring a VPN connection.</div>
<div></div>
<div>Each student will be assigned a <strong>student KVM virtual machine</strong> (CentOS 8) of their own to do task-oriented homework assignments. Each student virtual machine will have a non-routable, <strong>private IP</strong> address which is accessible via ssh from the course server.&nbsp; Initially there is only the root account but in homework 1, students will create a user account for themselves.</div>
