## Services and Ports

Looking at the `/etc/services` file you will see a long list of the most well known services. Ports 1024 and lower are considered to be "privileged" ports and traditionally require root privileges to start up software that bind to them.

User's programs can usually bind to any ports 1025 and higher.

Just because a daemon/service is typically associated with a particular port or range of ports does not mean that it has to use those ports. Most applications can be configured to use whatever port(s) desired. Therefore do not assume that if a particular port is in use that a particular app is using it. Remember you are free to name binaries anything you want and sometimes unauthorized users try to be tricky.

## IPTABLES Overview

- Filtering is performed by the network stack within the kernel
- Asserts policies at OSI Reference Model layers 2, 3 and 4
- Only packet headers are inspected

> Filtering is preformed by the network stack in the kernel

## FIREWALLD Overview

- Red Hat introduced a new firewall system with the release of RHEL7, named `firewalld`.
- There is a `firewalld` GUI named firewall-config and a CLI program named __firewall-cmd__.
- `firewalld` supports multiple zones

## Using FIREWALLD

Check to see if firewalld is running:

```bash
$ systemctl status firewalld
```

firewalld stores its rules in: `/etc/firewalld/zones/public.xml`

    firewall-cmd --state
    firewall-cmd --get-active-zones
    firewall-cmd --list-all

    firewall-cmd --add-service=http
    firewall-cmd --add-service=http --permanent
    firewall-cmd --remove-service=http
    firewall-cmd --remove-service=http --permanent

    firewall-cmd --add-port=30000/tcp --permanent
    firewall-cmd --add-port=30000-30010/tcp --permanent
    firewall-cmd --remove-port=30000/tcp --permanent
    firewall-cmd --remove-port=30000-30010/tcp --permanent

    firewall-cmd --reload
    firewall-cmd --complete-reload
    firewall-cmd --query-panic
    firewall-cmd --panic-on
    firewall-cmd --panic-off

## FIREWALLD SERVICE FILES

    firewall-cmd --get-services
    /usr/lib/firewalld/services/{service-name}.xml

    firewall-cmd --info-service={service-name}
