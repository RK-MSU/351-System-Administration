<h3>What exactly is a "System Administrator"?</h3>
<div>System administration is a very broad topic and depending on a particular job or company it can range from being a "jack of all trades but master of none" to being very specialized. This course is going to attempt to give as broad a base of sysadmin information / experience as possible without being able to delve too deeply into any particular topic.</div>
<p>Specialized types:</p>
<ul>
<li>Web server - Often referred to as webmaster</li>
<li>Database - Often referred to as DBA
<ul>
<li>Oracle</li>
<li>MySQL</li>
<li>PostgreSQL</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Email - Often referred to as postmaster</li>
<li>Network Administrator</li>
<li>Security</li>
<li>Storage Management</li>
<li>Virtualization</li>
<li>Any other server application you can think of</li>
</ul>
<p>Working with End Users<br /><br />A System Administrator, whether warranted or not, often has a reputation for not being a "people person". They are often seen as grumpy, lazy and someone who speaks a language all their own... filled with technical jargon that non-computer types don't understand.</p>
<ul>
<li>End users don't usually formulate their questions very well.</li>
<li>End users are often uncomfortable talking to a system administrator and feel as they will be perceived as being stupid or negligent.</li>
<li>They often have misinformation or a bad understanding of how something works.</li>
<li>It is up to you to ask questions before you start providing answers so you can make sure you understand what they really need / want. It is often useful to back up from a problem or request and try to see the bigger picture.</li>
<li>Try your best to educate your users and show them how to collect troubleshooting information so they can become partners rather than adversaries.</li>
<li>After a few positive experiences some of your users may end up becoming "assistant administrators" because you have educated them where they may be able to help others.</li>
<li>Try to find multiple solutions rather than just the simplest and if appropriate, let the end user choose which one is better for them.</li>
<li>End users often have good ideas. Make sure to acknowledge them and try to apply them where appropriate.</li>
<li>Having a good relationship with your customers will always make your job easier.</li>
<li>Don't be afraid to say you don't know something and that you'll have to do some research.</li>
<li>Make sure to follow through to completion in a timely fashion and do follow-up calls / visits to ensure a solution is working.</li>
<li>Recognize when you need to create documentation for yourself and your users. Use FAQs or SOPs. Provide your users with as much documentation as they are comfortable with.</li>
<li>Try to track problems and recognize trends with users, software, and hardware.</li>
</ul>
